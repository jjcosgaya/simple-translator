* Simple Translator
  I made this simple extension to quickly translate texts on the web by selecting them. This is useful for language learning, among other things.
  I wanted something simple, quick, and as less distracting and annoying as possible.

  Once you've selected the /from/ and /to/ languages, simply select the text you want to translate. The translation will appear in a box that follows the mouse, so you can move it around in case it's possition bothers you.

  Once you don't want to see the translation any more, simply click on the screen and the box will go away.
